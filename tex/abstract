We propose to use HST to characterize a dark-matter subhalo in the Milky Way. Tidally disrupted globular clusters create thin and kinematically cold stellar streams that are extremely sensitive to any gravitational perturbation. Orbiting in the Milky Way halo, these streams provide a unique opportunity to test for the presence of perturbing dark-matter subhalos. Gaps discovered along streams provide tentative evidence for dark matter influence, but their origin remains uncertain as stream gaps alone can be due to baryonic effects as well. Recently, Gaia observations of the GD-1 stellar stream have revealed a spur of stars associated with one of the gaps in the stream. Such features naturally arise when a stream encounters a massive perturber, and have a unique 3D kinematic signature. We propose here to measure precise proper motions in the perturbed region of GD-1. We will target eight fields with ACS/WFC and parallel-observe with WFC3/UVIS in two epochs. Proper motion accuracies near 3 km/s will be achieved by measuring the relative motion between stream stars and background galaxies using established techniques that have already been successfully applied to other objects in the Local Group (e.g., LMC/SMC, Leo I, M31, Sgr and Lethe streams). A passing subhalo is expected to introduce differences in tangential velocity between the stream and the spur, and our data will have the precision to resolve these kinematic offsets. Our results will definitively establish whether GD-1 features are a signature of a dark matter subhalo. If HST confirms the subhalo origin of the gap, it will measure the physical properties of the subhalo and rule out all reasonable alternatives.
